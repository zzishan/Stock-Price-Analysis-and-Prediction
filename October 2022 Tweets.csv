"2022-10-06","Yeah. He has to sell Tesla stock. There is a difference between net worth and liquidity. He doesn't have liquidity without putting Tesla under pressure"
"2022-10-06","I agree. The SEC was going to fine him he had no choice but to go through with this deal. But the original deal was to leverage Tesla stock which has declined in value. If nobody’s willing to loan him money against the Tesla stock he’s going to have to sell Tesla stock & pay tax"
"2022-10-06","10/ Second, it will conserve judicial resources if the deal  now closes. Third, and most importantly, I am guessing the Chancellor knows Musk needs to sell $TSLA stock to fund his obligations, and that until after Tesla reports earnings (Oct 22), Musk can't start selling."
"2022-10-06","Exactly. His wealth is based on the market cap of Tesla stock. If he sells a bunch of it, the price drops, as does his net wealth. If he can borrow off stock collateral, the stock stays fine, but straight selling kills the value and his wealth."
"2022-10-06","I had to sell $37,000 of my tesla stock. It was hard but then I bought my 3 Tesla battery packs for my solar system and had them installed and that felt good."

"2022-10-06","Despite what the lede on this story says, banks and SV bigwigs did not ""clamor"" to be part of this deal. Banks only underwrote 1/3 and heavily syndicated that part. They made Elon put up his Tesla stock for another chunk. And then a few rich buds chipped in money."
"2022-10-06","@matt_levine says "" @elonmusk   liquid wealth consists mostly of @Tesla  stock, and to come up with $33.5 billion he would need to either (1) sell $33.5 billion of Tesla stock "" or borrow against it. But what about #taxes? He's have to sell more than $33.5B"

"2022-10-28","This is great but 1-2 hours after you plug in your car to charge it, the PowerWalls will get depleted and then you don't have enough to run the home.It takes a lot of solar panels during peak sun to charge the car (220v 40amp) without grid, but running home is > 10x easier."

"2022-10-28","Wasn't @TSLA supposed to tank many times over the past week? Like $100 here we come, etc? Seems like it's doing much better than many other big businesses. In any case, it wasn't Tesla that bought Twitter, it was Elon and other investors."

"2022-10-28","It's worse than that. Elon leveraged too much of his Tesla stock. If twitter goes down he may lose Tesla and/or SpaceX. Buying twitter was the dumbest thing he could've done."

"2022-10-28","My guess is Elon takes this site back to 2017 levels of hell. That would obviously suck, but I don't think it causes an exodus of users. I also think Elon will sell it relatively soon. It'll be a way for him to cash out some of his Tesla stock without causing a panic"
"2022-10-28","Not really. Tesla stock is crashing pretty hard as people are realizing just how overinflated it is. SpaceX is entirely propped up by Nasa abs Mars commercial will never happen. Neuralink is another scam that comes to mind."

"2022-10-28","It's still blowing my mind a bit because Tesla stock has tanked since the deal was first proposed, he's buying Twitter at an inflated price (which is why the existing management was obligated to go through with the deal), and I'm certain Twitter stock will crash too now."

"2022-10-28","Please buy Tesla stock Tuesdays."
"2022-10-28","Elon F'd himself BIG TIME with the twitter deal. The financing arrangement is horrific and he cannot afford to alienate people or loose revenue. He has pledged his stock as collateral between twitter and other ventures. Tesla stock price keeps falling. I smell a Margin Call."
"2022-10-28","Yeah that’s not true at all, SpaceX has been receiving contracts from NASA since 2006. The main source of his boom in net worth was Tesla stock going through the roof."
"2022-10-28","See you again when Tesla stock tanks because Musk pisses off all his potential customers on Twitter and somebody sues *that* board."
"2022-10-28","No, I will leave.  Allowing Trump back on this platform will be providing a platform and aiding a known seditious traitor.  If it does happen, I'm sure there will be many lawsuits and inquiries by the DOJ.  I'd look to see Tesla stock tank again as well."
"2022-10-28","So I don't know. Musk, as wierd as it seems right now, is broke AF, and Twitter got better because of a series of lawsuits requiring more moderation. I think he's gonna either get burned or flip it. I still think he only did it for cover to sell Tesla stock and got burned."
"2022-10-28","Tesla stock is down 50 pct this year. Musk will drive Twitter into the ground given time. Someone, or some company, will buy Twitter down the road for much less than Musk paid."
"2022-10-28","It’s so funny you said that because my 5 month old last week told me to buy more Tesla stock.  I couldn’t believe it but those words actually came out of her mouth.  So I did."
"2022-10-28","The vast majority of his net worth is Tesla stock. And it's about 210 billion as of yesterday."
"2022-10-28","What isn't talked about is Elon's backers. He didn't pay $44 bil of his own money. He doesn't actually have that much. Part of it came from sale of Tesla stock too."
"2022-10-28","I’m interested in how the “experts” will react tomorrow for Tesla stock."
"2022-10-28","Tesla stock is currently 10x what it was a few years ago.  You have no idea what you’re talking about."
"2022-10-28","...Elon will likely have to sell Tesla stock, which also means he'll lose a controlling share, which makes him very vulnerable to a hostile takeover. I realize that there are a lot of bigots out there in the world who feel emboldened to spew their BS publically, but...2/"
"2022-10-28","He blustered his way into a bad deal when Tesla stock was in a bubble that has since popped.And like all the super-wealthy oligarchs, he thinks he knows how to run the world and has the right to in order to become even wealthier."
"2022-10-28","Many advertisers already warned him not to allow the Giant Toddler back.If he loses advertisers he'll lose face, and if he tries an IPO, Twitter won't be worth half of what he paid...He actually paid twice it's worth by buying it with Tesla stock worth 50% what it used to be"
"2022-10-28","Facebook is much much worse. I deleted my account a couple of years ago and I will never return.Musk's sales of Tesla stock have reduced him to 15% ownership. I'm curious as to when the large institutional investors will force him out as CEO."
"2022-10-28","Tesla is a joke. SpaceX is a joke.This man has said we would be on Mars by now more than Al Gore said the ice caps would be melted.The only people who buy Tesla stock are limp-dicked chavs and hipsters, people who couldn't work a real job and contribute to society."
"2022-10-28","It's so he could dump his Tesla stock so he can slowly lose money instead of rapidly losing money."
"2022-10-28","I call him ""Enron Musk"" for a reason.He's just taken $65 billion of his own Tesla stock and thrown it in with the $90 billion of Tesla stock he's already pledged for other loans. That's $155 billion.Once the value of his Tesla stock holdings dips below that figure, he's done."
"2022-10-28","He's a fool who's about to experience real consequences for the first time in his life.Tesla stock was trading well over $1200 a year ago - or $400 calculated as post-split. It's now struggling to stay above $220 as real car companies increase their share of the EV market."
"2022-10-28","The broad truth is that few sectors are as exposed to a recession as the auto industry. With Tesla stock falling, buying Twitter could be a way for Elon Musk to invest in something more defensive, writes @willydunn."
"2022-10-28","It may not wipe him out entirely but if the value went to zero, he’d be forced to sell off a load it Tesla stock which would cause its share price to plummet and almost all of his net worth is thereUs being here is money in his pocket"
"2022-10-28","If nothing else, as of right now we've cost Elon Musk $44 billion in cash, stock sales (which damaged Tesla) and massive debt.That's kind of comforting."
"2022-10-28","Bought Tesla stock back in 2017 when everyone was telling me it was going to fail! How did that work out? Same vibes as Cardano tbh. Everyone wants us to fail but all it does is make us stronger! Elon will make Twitter the most successful platform in the universe!"
"2022-10-28","I'm so very thankful that the $TWTR overhang on $TSLA has finally lifted — you can see how much it was actually weighing down the stock price... same as with Tesla's credit rating. Now, if only Tesla would get a PR dept we'd be all set"

"2022-10-28","There’s a reason $TSLA stock has not bounced back — Twitter “overhang” got replaced by a far more serious overhang: criminal probes by DoJ and SEC which could quickly expand and lead right up to Musk, potentially leading to his removal as CEO."
